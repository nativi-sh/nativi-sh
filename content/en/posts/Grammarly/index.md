### Language Support: Nativish Covers All Languages
Grammarly primarily focuses on English, with limited support for other languages. This can be a significant drawback for multilingual users or those working in non-native languages. Nativish supports all languages, making it an ideal choice for a global audience. Whether you’re writing in Spanish, Arabic, French, Russian or any other language (Klingon included!), Nativish ensures that your text is accurate and native-sounding.

**Key Benefits:**
- Supports all languages
- Ideal for multilingual users
- Ensures native-sounding text

### Contextual Accuracy: Nativish Understands Your Writing Better
Understanding the context of a sentence is crucial for making relevant corrections. Most writing assistants applications, including Grammarly, ignore context, leading to suboptimal corrections. Nativish, powered by the latest language learning models, excels in this area by providing highly relevant corrections based on the context of your writing.

**Key Benefits:**
- Superior contextual corrections
- Accurate and relevant edits
- Reduces errors in complex sentences

### Efficient Correction Process: Save Time with Nativish
Grammarly requires users to accept corrections one by one, which can be time-consuming, especially for long documents. Accepting corrections can then lead to more corrections popping up, in a seemingly frustrating process.
Nativish improves efficiency by providing all corrections at once, while still allowing users to see and review each change. This feature is particularly beneficial for professionals or writers who need to process large volumes of text quickly without compromising on accuracy.

**Key Benefits:**
- All corrections provided at once
- Saves time on long documents
- Maintains control over edits

### Preserving Voice and Style: Nativish Respects Your Unique Writing
Maintaining an individual’s voice and style in writing is essential, particularly for creative professionals and content creators. Grammarly can sometimes alter the tone of the text significantly. Nativish, however, respects the writer’s voice and style, making only the necessary edits to ensure the writing sounds native and natural.

**Key Benefits:**
- Preserves unique voice and style
- Makes only necessary edits
- Ensures natural and native-sounding text
