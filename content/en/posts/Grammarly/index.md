### Nativish Catches More Typos Than Grammarly

### Contextual Accuracy: Nativish Understands Your Writing Better
Understanding the context of a sentence is crucial for making relevant corrections. Most writing assistant applications, including Grammarly, ignore context, leading to suboptimal corrections. Nativish, powered by the latest language learning models, excels in this area by providing highly relevant corrections based on the context of your writing.

&nbsp;
**Key Benefits:**
- Superior contextual corrections
- Accurate and relevant edits
- Fewer errors in complex sentences

{{< figure src="grammarly_example_perigee.png" width="500" alt="Nativish writing assistant app interface" caption="Grammarly doesn't detect that 'perigee' is not the correct word in context since it applies to Earth orbit only" class="border-no-padding">}}

{{< figure src="nativish_example_perigee.jpg" width="300" alt="Nativish writing assistant app interface" caption="Nativish leverages context to provide the correct word, 'periapsis'" class="border-no-padding">}}

### Preserving Voice and Style: Nativish Respects Your Unique Writing
Maintaining an individual‚Äôs voice and style in writing is essential, particularly for creative professionals and content creators. Grammarly can sometimes alter the tone of the text significantly. Nativish, however, respects the writer‚Äôs voice and style, making only the necessary edits to ensure the writing sounds native and natural.

&nbsp;
**Key Benefits:**
- Preserves unique voice and style
- Makes only necessary edits
- Ensures natural and native-sounding text

{{< figure src="nativish_example_eminem.jpg" width="300" alt="Nativish writing assistant app interface" caption="Nativish's suggestion preserves the voice while making only the necessary changes to be grammatically correct." class="border-no-padding">}}



### Efficient Correction Process: Save Time with Nativish
Grammarly requires users to accept corrections one by one, which can be time-consuming, especially for long documents. Accepting corrections can then lead to more corrections appearing, creating a seemingly frustrating process.
Nativish improves efficiency by providing all corrections at once, while still allowing users to see and review each change. This feature is particularly beneficial for professionals or writers who need to process large volumes of text quickly without compromising on accuracy.

&nbsp;
**Key Benefits:**
- All corrections provided at once
- Saves time on long documents
- Maintains control over edits
