Learning a new language is challenging, and even advanced learners can make mistakes. Here are some common mistakes non-native speakers make and tips on how to avoid them.

### 1. Using False Friends
False friends are words that look similar in two languages but have different meanings. For example, in Spanish, "embarazada" means pregnant, not embarrassed. To avoid this, always double-check the meaning of words that seem familiar.

### 2. Incorrect Word Order
Different languages have different rules for word order. In English, the standard order is subject-verb-object, but this may not be the case in your native language. Practice constructing sentences in the correct order.

### 3. Misusing Prepositions
Prepositions can be tricky because they don't always translate directly between languages. For example, in English, we say "interested in" something, not "interested on" or "interested about." Learn the correct prepositions for common phrases.

### 4. Literal Translations
Translating phrases word-for-word from your native language can lead to awkward or incorrect sentences. Instead, learn the idiomatic expressions and common phrases used by native speakers.

### 5. Overusing or Underusing Articles
Articles (a, an, the) can be confusing, especially if your native language doesn't use them in the same way. Pay attention to when articles are used and try to mimic native speakers.

### 6. Pronunciation Errors
Pronunciation can greatly affect how well you're understood. Practice difficult sounds and pay attention to intonation and stress patterns in words.

### 7. Incorrect Verb Tenses
Using the wrong verb tense is a common mistake. Make sure you understand the different tenses and when to use them. Regular practice and exposure to native speakers can help.

### Tips for Improvement
- **Practice Regularly**: Consistent practice is key to improvement.
- **Use Language Apps**: Tools like Nativish can provide corrections and explanations for your writing.
- **Read and Listen**: Exposure to the language through reading and listening will help you learn correct usage.
- **Get Feedback**: Have native speakers or language teachers review your work and provide feedback.

Avoiding these common mistakes will help you sound more like a native speaker and improve your overall fluency. Keep practicing and using tools like Nativish to guide your learning journey.
