### The Inspiration Behind Nativish

Nativish was born out of a love story and a personal need. I, Claire, am a French native who has been living in the United States for years. I wasn't going to remain in the US that long, but I met Brian... and changed my mind. We got married and had a lot of wonderful adventures together, and it's only the beginning!

### Claire's Challenge

I work in an American company, where I need to write for the website and send emails in English. Despite being fluent, writing at a native level in English is challenging and time-consuming for me. Even though I am really good at English, I find that achieving native-level writing is hard. This is a common issue for many professionals working in a language different from their native one. I tried many tools, whether writing assistants or translation tools, but none could really help.

### Brian's Story

My husband, Brian, has a deep love for languages. He speaks fluent Russian and has a good level of Arabic. Since marrying me, he has become fluent in French. However, he feels he needs immersion to truly master the language. Living in the U.S. makes this challenging, as we mostly speak English at home, and he often feels self-conscious when writing messages to my family.

### The Solution: Nativish

Seeing these challenges, we realized the need for a tool that helps people achieve native-level fluency in writing. Nativish was created to make work and family communication easier for people like us. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI, building a smart language learning app is more achievable than ever.
